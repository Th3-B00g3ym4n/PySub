# PySub

A simple Python library site-package used to
scan a domain for sub-domains

## Usage/example


```python
import pysub

def main():
  pysub.start("google.com" #the url, secure=True #HTTP/HTTPS)
  print(pysub.scan.output)

main()
```

## installation
As I don't know how to create pip packages just download the zip
Navigate to **Users/"user"/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python311/Lib/site-packages**

and put the files a new folder named **PySub**
